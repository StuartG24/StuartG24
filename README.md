# Stuart Gow's Repo

Just starting my PhD at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Centre for Robotics. Just finished my AI MSc at the University of Stirling. This follows a long 'first' career as programme manager, project manager and consultant in financial services organisations in the UK, Continental Europe and North America.

Some of my assignments, projects are published here. Hopefully, the projects will grow in complexity and worth!
