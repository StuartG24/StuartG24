# Stuart Gow's Repo

I am half-way through my AI MSc at the University of Stirling and will be commencing a PhD this Autumn. This follows a long 'first' career as programme manager, project manager and consultant in financial services organisations in the UK, Continental Europe and North America.

Some of my assignments, projects are published here. Hopefully, the projects will grow in complexity and worth!
